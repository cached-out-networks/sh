#readline: stable 8.0.4 (bottled) [keg-only]
#Library for command-line editing

#/usr/local/Cellar/readline/8.0.4 (48 files, 1.5MB)

#From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/readline.rb
#==> Caveats
#readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
#because macOS provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
#In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
#defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.
#
#For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
#  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"
#  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/readline/include"
#
#For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
#  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"
