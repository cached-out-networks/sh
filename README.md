bash shell code snippets pulled in by ~/.bashrc, which iterates over the ~/sh/* files and sources each one (unless the file \=\~ ".disabled$")

use this to setup my environment, plop in a new bit of shell code in a new file or modify an existing file and reload with 'source ~/.bashrc' (which i have alias'd to 'reload')
